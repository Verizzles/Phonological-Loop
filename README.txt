Loop.py require Speak.py and speech.py to run.
speech.py is the speech module, and does yield timing
Speak.py converts the words in the list being read to DM chunks
Loop.py calls on speeech.py to speak and takes the chunk outputs of Speak.py and shoves it into its declarative memory

Only primacy effect can be seen here, Recency is fake news.
